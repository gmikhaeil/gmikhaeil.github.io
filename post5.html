<div class = "a">It’s been over 2 years since my last post in August 2019. Currently it is May 2021. I’ve accomplished a surprising number of things since then....
<p>I’m now 24 (kind of old right?),
<p>I’ve successfully graduated from Texas A&M University (which still feels surreal and a miracle), 
<p>I accepted, and am a year into my first ever Full-Time job,
<p>I moved to a city that I knew NOTHING ABOUT in the middle of nowhere for said job,
<p>I’ve seen my best friends and family get engaged, I’ve attended countless weddings, 
<p>I’ve seen relationships start, and I’ve seen them end. I’ve seen heartbreak in many different ways with many different people,
<p>I think I’ve matured.... 
<p>....but I think that I’ve accepted the importance of my inner child,
<p><p>I’ve seen and witnessed a world pandemic occur and change everybody’s life.
<p>It’s been an absolutely wonderful ride. I don’t think I have any regrets, and I don’t think I’ll get to the point where I actually do. I always do wonder what would happen if one of many things changed, I wonder if I had not accepted a job so far from home? I wonder what would’ve happen if I had been blunter and more direct with my intentions. I wonder what would’ve happen if I had given up on all hope. I wonder what would’ve happened had this past year be that uneventful instead of the wildness it was! I’ve talked about jumping into unknowns, taking leaps of faith, pursuing happiness, dealing with my own inner conflicts, but have I actually learned anything? Have I actually done anything different? Have I actually become a better me?
<p>I don’t think I have an answer, I think only time and the decisions I make can decide that. 
But I still don’t have regrets. I still feel like I’m the same me. I’ve planned on not changing, I’ve planned on continuously keeping that inner child out and about. Ultimately, I’ve planned on becoming a better more defined George Mikhaeil. And that’s the hard question, how do we keep ourselves honest? Is it therapy, a relationship, our friends ad family? How do we make sure that we are the same every day? How do we make sure that no matter how many surprises occur, whether it’s a new job, a new city or a world pandemic, we only grow in a direction that we approve of?  
<p>I keep thinking and I don’t think there is an answer. But every time I think of what could be an answer, I think back to my experiences, to my family, and to my friends. The memories, the mistakes, the conflicts, the fights, the absolute failures, and the triumphs.

<p> <h2> And maybe a combination of what I think back to is the answer.</h2> </p>
