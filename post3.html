      <p>So what the hell is this? Well, thats actually super hard to answer! What started as a detour to procrastinate studying for my final exams, has officially turned into something that I have chosen to start updating. 100% free of will. My decision. 
		Nothing forcing me nor holding me back. And I feel like this should only be a proper introduction.</p>
      
	  <p><h1><b>HOWDY</b></h1>
	  
	  <p><strong>My Name is George Mikhaeil, I am an Electrical Engineering Major from Cypress, TX</strong></p>
	  <p><b>BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I AM THE LOUDEST AND THE PROUDEST MEMBER OF THE FIGHTIN' TEXAS AGGIE CLASS OF 2019</b></p>

	  <p><h1><b>A-A-A WHOOP</b></h1>

	  <p>Between me and you, I'll probably never EVER get tired of that. Before I came to college my brother (who went to t.u.) told me, "dont get brainwashed bro", but this is different.
		Texas A&M has actually shown me that ...
		
		<h4>From the outside in you cant understand it, and from the inside out you cant explain it</h4>
		
		<p>...and honestly, that quote is very heavily used because it is very VERY accurate to this university.
		But enough about tamu, literally i'll have many obligiatory posts about this school. MORE ABOUT ME!
		
		<p>Currently I am the Member Developement Chair of Paradigm: Forging Model Men of Aggieland, which honestly is a huge honor for me. This organization really gave me a totally
		different environment to both live and breath in and I love every single second of it. I'm also NOT a college dropout 
		(thankfully my grades were good enough to were the university did NOT ask for my resignation). I am a member of Coptic Aggies (Because i am Coptic Orthodox (which is an honor of its own)). 
		But most importantly, I am a self proclaimed crazy person!! I may have just turned 20, but there is not doubt in my mind that 
		I will remain at least 5 years of age mentally. 
		
		<p>To me, thats a proper introduction. And I will continue introducing myself as time moves on.<p>
		<p>so back to the important question, why this? why now? and how. Well to start the answers i'll begin with this,
		I don't know where I am going in life, and honestly, Its occured to me, that I (for some reason) can help people in ways that others never noticed.
		I'm starting the quest for insanity and happiness. But that is a very missleading quest, because while the insanity may be what I am striving for,
		the happiness is what my goal is. But it is not happiness in myself. Actually, It's happiness in my surroundings. This is a quest which has siletly been going on
		ever since the banana came into play. The banana which is truly a source of laughter and uniquness is only the beginning of this quest. The kazoo is only the beginning of this quest,
		Texas A&M is only the beginning of this quest. This LIFE-LONG quest to truly make as many people happier as I possibly can. And it has occured to me, that a documantation 
		is needed to acheive that goal. So heres the documentation. You know the goal. You know the WHY. 
		
		<p>but will you join?
		
		<p>not my decision.
