	<p>IDK! but here is a picture of georgie since i owe him one. <a target="_blank" href= "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/13392027_10208861471594675_474425677219380357_o.jpg">@DOC</a> </PRE>
	a simple, yet really freaken difficult question, BUT WHY THIS PAGE?! 
	
	<blockquote>
		Lets start with the best part, WHO AM I?
		HOWDY! My name is George Mikhaeil, I'm an Electrical Engineering Major from Cypress, TX but most importantly, I AM THE LOUDEST AND THE PROUDEST MEMBER OF THE FIGHTEN TEXAS AGGIE CLASS OF 2019.
		<p>A mouthfull right? I can say it all day lol.
		<p>On another note, this website is created by ME for the idea that i will start documenting all of the problems / projects i come across for not only myself but for anybody that wants it! Want physics notes? I'll post em here, How about calc? You be-cha.
		The concept for all this came randomly while I was studying for finals and honestly, ended up as a major procrastination for like a solid hour. Now its turned into a really clean (-ish) looking website!!
