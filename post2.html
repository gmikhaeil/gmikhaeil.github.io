      <p>It is currently 1:00 am on the first day of summer session 2 and I am still doing homework for one of the hardest classes I’ve ever taken. 
	  But in the midst of not understanding I took a study break and went to my fridge to get an eggo waffle.
	  However, rather than reaching into my freezer, I took note of the article I ripped out of THE BATTALIAN and took the time to read it again for encouragement. 
	  What it reads follows.
		
	<div class="w3-container w3-light-grey">
	<p><q><i>The Pursuit of Happiness sucks. The phrase itself should make you avoid it at all costs. To pursue means to struggle; 
	to exert time and energy against some obstructive force. Things that are pursued run from their pursuer, and things that pursue 
	usually do so without good intentions. Cats pursue mice, lions pursue antelopes, and big fish pursue small fish. Why do we have 
	to do the same to happiness? 
	
	<p><q>The answer can only be understood when you consider the absence of happiness. Without achieving their pursuits the lion 
	and the big fish will starve. In other words, you truly pursue something when it is vital to your survival and you do not have it yet.
	
	<p><q>It is easy to forget how lucky we are that our pursuits of happiness are often so easy they lose this meaning. College life is a pursuit of many things 
	- grades, jobs, Aggie Rings – but happiness is just a friend, phone call, or trip home away. We may know happiness is not everywhere and in everything, but true sorrow
	is often a definition we still have no need for.
	
	<p><h6><q>[Happiness] is something that you must make a very conscientious effort to achieve. Happiness will not come to you, even if you are patient;
	it must be chased until your lungs burn.
	</div></i>

	As I begin my third year at this university, I think and remember of all the good and bad times that occurred, from the cliff jumps to the mental breakdowns. 
	Throughout the entire thing I now realize that one thing was consistent, the struggle to stay happy. While this struggle failed more times than I can count, 
	the result always ends up the same. I read this article because I need to remember what I do and why I do. I read this article because I fear for the absence of 
	happiness. I read this article because every day I know that no matter what, I can decide for myself how I want my journey to continue. 
	<p>Now if I may, I really need to stop procrastinating and get through this next problem. :)
