The constant struggle of trying to figure it out.

Honestly its gotten to the point of time where happiness no longer comes from the things i enjoyed the most. its sad that when students are in school, we get so stressed and locked into the non-importants, that the things we enjoy the most becomes beliefs from past and often non-achievable. Its really hard to catch a break especially when one needs it the most and the thought of school often turns me off and quite honestly, reuins me. I've found myself this semester lying to myself of how well things go. But thats not to say that we should always be depressed of what you want to do. More accurately, it should be a wake up call that while we have other obligations in life, nothing is worse then the damaging effects of our own mental stability. Ive worked so hard thinking of the future and of success that i've forgotten what i have and how much that should mean. I've skipped events i dont think i can ever relive with people that i love because i had to "study for an exam" or "do homework that was due yesterday but i couldn't do it".
